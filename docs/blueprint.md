## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of mystery and melancholy, reflecting the app's futuristic yet introspective mood.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-blue (#22232E). This creates a dark color scheme.
- Accent color: Electric violet (#8F00FF) for interactive elements, complementing the deep indigo and enhancing the futuristic feel.
- Font Pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Space Grotesk' is used for a techy feel, with 'Inter' is used in larger body text.
- Glassmorphism used for UI elements like modals, forms, and footers to give a modern, frosted-glass look. Organic silicon-based shapes drift in the background of the loading screen.
- Subtle animations for AI responses (shimmering effect), countdown timer (liquid bar depletion), and interactive elements (button glows) to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
- Use minimalist icons, with an emphasis on glowing and pulsating to enhance the modern feel. Iconography should represent various states of writing and reading (pens, paper, ticks, reading eye).
